# HartsEpos2020

A simple web calculator to estimate the likelihood of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) using criteria from the EPOS 2020 guidelines.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates how the diagnostic recommendations from the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2020 can be translated into an interactive tool. It is meant for educational use and does not replace professional medical evaluation.

## How the Calculator Works

1. Review the listed red flags. The presence of any of these signs means the patient should be referred immediately for specialized care.
2. Mark each symptom or sign that is present in the "Crit√©rios" section.
3. Click **Calcular** to see whether ABRS is likely (three or more criteria) or unlikely.

The result area explains whether antibiotic therapy should be considered according to EPOS 2020.

## Help Section

On the main page there is an **Ajuda** button. Clicking it toggles a short description of how to use the calculator and cites the EPOS 2020 reference. Use this help panel whenever you need a reminder of the steps above.
